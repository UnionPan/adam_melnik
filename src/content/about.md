My work as a lighting designer and photographer is a meditation on the language of illumination, crafted through countless hours in darkened theaters, beneath architectural canopies, and behind the lens, guided by an intuitive understanding of how light carves meaning from shadow. I seek moments where illumination reveals the invisible—the subtle interplay between human emotion and physical space, the way light can transform ordinary environments into vessels of profound experience, the manner in which shadows hold as much power as the brightest beam. 

The resulting compositions, whether cast across theater stages or captured in silver gelatin, intentionally blur the boundaries between the designed and the discovered, between the controlled and the spontaneous. My lighting designs provide me with a venue for bridging the ancient dialogue between performer and audience, between architecture and inhabitant, dissolving the separation between the illuminated and the illuminator. I am always seeking to understand my own relationship to light by witnessing how it touches my subjects—whether actors on stage or figures in my photographs—and likewise, discovering how their presence shapes my perception of illumination itself.
