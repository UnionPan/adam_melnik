	<h2>Creative Journey</h2>
	<p>
		I'm Adam Melnik, a lighting designer and passionate photographer who has spent years exploring the transformative power of light. My journey began with a fascination for how light can shape mood, tell stories, and create unforgettable experiences in both live performance and still imagery.
	</p>

	<h2>Professional Expertise</h2>
	<p>
		My work spans multiple disciplines within the world of lighting and visual arts. I bring technical precision and artistic vision to every project:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Theatrical Lighting:</strong> Concert halls, theaters, and live performance venues</li>
		<li><strong>Architectural Lighting:</strong> Building facades, interior spaces, and landscape illumination</li>
		<li><strong>Photography:</strong> Fine art, portraits, landscapes, and commercial work</li>
		<li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> ETC consoles, MA Lighting, Adobe Creative Suite, and advanced camera systems</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Artistic Philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		I believe that light is the universal language of emotion. Whether I'm designing the lighting for a theatrical production or capturing a fleeting moment through my camera lens, I strive to create visual narratives that resonate with audiences on a deep, emotional level.
	</p>

	<p>
		My approach combines technical expertise with intuitive artistry. I'm constantly experimenting with new techniques, from cutting-edge LED technology in my lighting designs to innovative photographic processes that push the boundaries of traditional image-making.
	</p>

	<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
	<p>
		I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects ranging from intimate theater productions to large-scale architectural installations. Each project presents unique challenges and opportunities to explore how light can transform spaces and experiences.
	</p>

	<h2>Let's Collaborate</h2>
	<p>
		I'm always excited to discuss new creative projects, whether it's lighting design for your next production, architectural illumination, or a photography collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-melnik-20" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or through my contact information.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not behind a lighting console or camera, you'll find me exploring new locations for photography, attending art exhibitions, or experimenting with new lighting techniques in my studio.
